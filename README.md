# Delivery_app
Simple Delivery app which allows to create and track delivery processes of packages

## Implementation

### Backend
It is written on Java Spring. Java Spring is being used in order to generate and communicate with the database.  
As the Hibernate allows to use CodeFirst approach for the database, the generated tables are being stored and managed in MySQL server (I am accessing it via MySQL Workbench personally)

### Frontend
ThymeLeaf templates are being used here with a bit of CSS
